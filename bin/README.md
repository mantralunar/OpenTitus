# Readme for /bin folder

This is the binary folder, the one that end users will use.

## Instructions:
* Place original game files in `moktar` and/or `titus` folder.
* Build and install into the `bin` folder according to the build instructions.
* Use the correct titus.conf file (rename titus_moktar.conf to titus.conf if you want to play moktar).
* Run `opentitus`.

Please do not upload the original game files to the git server, as they are proprietary!
